"Section <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t07c013.htm#7-13-710">7-13-710</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>(A)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; When <strike>any</strike> <u>a</u> person presents himself to vote, he shall produce <strike>his</strike> <u>a</u> valid <u>and current:</u>
</p><p>
<u>(1)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; South Carolina driver's license<u>;</u> <strike>or</strike>
</p><p>
<u>(2)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; other form of identification containing a photograph issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles<u>;</u><strike> ,if he is not licensed to drive, or the written notification of registration provided for by Sections <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t07c005.htm#7-5-125">7-5-125</a> and <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t07c005.htm#7-5-180">7-5-180</a> if the notification has been signed by the elector</strike>

<u>(4)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>military identification containing a photograph issued by the federal government;</u>
</p><p>
<u>(5)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>employee identification card containing a photograph of the voter, which is issued by the federal government or this State; or</u>
</p><p>
<u>(6)&nbsp; &nbsp; South Carolina voter registration card containing a photograph of the voter pursuant to Section <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t07c005.htm#7-5-675">7-5-675</a>.</u>
</p><p>
<strike>If the elector loses or defaces his registration notification, 
he may obtain a duplicate notification from his county board of 
registration upon request in person, or by telephone or mail.</strike>
</p><p>
<u>(B)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; After presentation of the required identification <u>described in subsection (A)</u>, <strike>his</strike> <u>the elector's</u>
 name must be checked by one of the managers on the margin of the page 
opposite his name upon the registration books, or copy of the books, 
furnished by the board of registration.  <u>One of the managers also 
shall compare the photograph contained on the required identification 
with the person presenting himself to vote.  The manager shall verify 
that the photograph is that of the person seeking to vote.</u>  The managers shall keep a poll list which must contain one column headed 'Names of Voters'.  Before <strike>any</strike> <u>a</u>
 ballot is delivered to a voter, the voter shall sign his name on the 
poll list, which must be furnished to the appropriate election officials
 by the State Election Commission.  At the top of each page the voter's 
oath appropriate to the election must be printed.  The signing of the 
poll list or the marking of the poll list is considered to be an 
affirmation of the oath by the voter.  One of the managers shall compare
 the signature on the poll list with the signature on the voter's 
driver's license, registration notification, or other identification and
 may require further identification of the voter and proof of his right 
to vote under this title as he considers necessary.  If the voter is 
unable to write or if the voter is prevented from signing by physical 
handicap, he may sign his name to the poll list by mark with the 
assistance of one of the managers.
</p><p>
<u>(C)(1)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>If the elector cannot produce the 
identification as required in subsection (A), he may cast a provisional 
ballot that is counted only if the elector brings a valid and current 
photo identification to the county board of registration and elections 
prior to certification of the election by the county board of 
canvassers. </u>
</p><p>
<u>(2)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>If the manager disputes that the photograph 
contained on the required identification is the person presenting 
himself to vote, the elector may cast a provisional ballot.  A 
determination of that provisional ballot must be made in accordance with
 Section <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t07c013.htm#7-13-830">7-13-830</a>.</u>
</p><p>
<u>(D)(1)(a)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>If an elector does not produce a valid 
and current photograph identification due to a religious objection to 
being photographed, he may complete an affidavit under penalty of 
perjury at the polling place and affirm that the elector: (i) is the 
same individual who personally appeared at the polling place; (ii) cast 
the provisional ballot on election day; and (iii) has a religious 
objection to being photographed.  Upon completion of the affidavit, the 
elector may cast a provisional ballot. </u><b><u> </u></b><u>The 
affidavit must be submitted with the provisional ballot envelope and be 
filed with the county board of registration and elections prior to 
certification of the election by the county board of canvassers.</u>
</p><p>
<u>(b)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>If an elector does not produce a valid and 
current photograph identification because the elector suffers from a 
reasonable impediment that prevents the elector from obtaining 
photograph identification, he may complete an affidavit under the 
penalty of perjury at the polling</u><i><u> </u></i><u>place and affirm 
that the elector: (i) is the same individual who personally appeared at 
the polling place; (ii) cast the provisional ballot on election day; and
 (iii) the elector suffers from a reasonable impediment that prevents 
him from obtaining photograph identification.  The elector must also 
list the impediment, unless otherwise prohibited by state or federal 
law.  Upon completion of the affidavit, the elector may cast a 
provisional ballot.  The affidavit must be submitted with the 
provisional ballot envelope and be filed with the county board of 
registration and elections prior to certification of the election by the
 county board of canvassers.</u>
</p><p>
<u>(2)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>If the county board of registration and 
elections determines that the voter was challenged solely for the 
inability to provide proof of identification and the required affidavit 
is submitted, the county board of registration and elections shall find 
that the provisional ballot is valid, unless the board has grounds to 
believe the affidavit is false. &nbsp;</u>
</p><p>
<u>(3)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>If the county board of registration and 
elections determines that the voter has been challenged for a cause 
other than the inability to provide proof of identification as required 
by subsection (A), the county board of registration and elections shall:</u>
</p><p>
<u>(a)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>note on the envelope containing the 
provisional ballot that the voter complied with the proof of 
identification requirement; and </u>
</p><p>
<u>(b)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>proceed to determine the validity of the remaining challenges before ruling on the validity of the provisional ballot.</u>
</p><p>
<u>(E)&nbsp; &nbsp; The purpose of the identification required pursuant 
to subsection (A) is to confirm the person presenting himself to vote is
 the elector on the poll list.  Any address listed on the identification
 is not determinative of an elector's domicile for the purpose of 
voting.  An elector's domicile for the purpose of voting is determined 
pursuant to the provisions of Section <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t07c001.htm#7-1-25">7-1-25</a>.</u>

"Section <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t07c005.htm#7-5-125">7-5-125</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>(A)</u>&nbsp;
 &nbsp; Any person who applies for registration to vote and is found to

</p><p>
<u>(B)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>If an elector loses or defaces his 
registration notification, he may obtain a duplicate notification from 
his county board of registration upon request in person, or by telephone
 or mail.</u>"

</p><p>
"Section <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t56c001.htm#56-1-3350">56-1-3350</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>(A)</u>&nbsp;
 &nbsp; Upon application by any person ten years of age or older who is a
 resident of South Carolina, the Department of Motor Vehicles shall 
issue a special identification card, as long as:
</p><p>
(1)&nbsp; &nbsp; the application is made on a form approved and furnished by the department; and
</p><p>
(2)&nbsp; &nbsp; the applicant presents to the person issuing the 
identification card a birth certificate or other evidence acceptable to 
the department of his name and date of birth.
</p><p>
<u>(B)(1)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; The fee for the issuance <u>and renewal</u> of the special identification card is five dollars<u> for a person between the ages of ten and sixteen years.</u>
</p><p>
<u>(2)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>An identification card must be free to a person aged seventeen years or older.</u>
</p><p>
<u>(C)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strike> and the</strike> <u>The</u> identification card expires five years from the date of issuance. <strike>
 The renewal fee is also five dollars.  Issuance and renewal fees are 
waived for indigent persons who are mentally ill, mentally retarded, 
homeless, or who are on public assistance as the sole source of income. 
 As used in this section "indigent" means a person who is qualified for 
legal assistance which is paid for with public funds.  For purposes of 
this section, a homeless person is an individual who lacks a fixed and 
regular nighttime residence or an individual who has a primary nighttime
 residence that is:</strike>
</p><p>
<strike>(a)</strike>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strike>a supervised publicly or 
privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living 
accommodations, including congregated shelters and transitional housing;</strike>
</p><p>
<strike>(b)</strike>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strike>an institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized;  or</strike>
</p><p>
<strike>(c)</strike>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strike>a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, regular sleeping accommodations for human beings.</strike>
</p><p>
<strike>The term does not include any individual imprisoned or otherwise
 detained pursuant to an act of Congress.  Annually, the director of a 
facility which provides care or shelter to homeless persons must certify
 this fact to the department.  The department must maintain a list of 
facilities which are approved by the department, and only letters from 
the directors of these approved facilities are considered to comply with
 the provisions of this section.  To have the issuance or renewal fee 
waived for an identification card, a homeless person must present a 
letter to the department from the director of a facility that provides 
care or shelter to homeless persons certifying that the person named in 
the letter is homeless.  The letter may not be older than thirty days.</strike>
</p><p>
<u>(D)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; Special identification cards issued to persons 
under the age of twenty-one must be marked, stamped, or printed to 
readily indicate that the person to whom the card is issued is under the
 age of twenty-one.
</p><p>
<u>(E)</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; The fees collected pursuant to this section must
 be credited to the Department of Transportation State Non-Federal Aid 
Highway Fund <strike>as provided in the following schedule based on the actual date of receipt by the Department of Motor Vehicles:</strike>

SECTION&nbsp; &nbsp; 14.&nbsp; &nbsp; The General Assembly finds that 
all the provisions contained in this act relate to one subject as 
required by Article III, Section 17 of the South Carolina Constitution 
in that each provision relates directly to or in conjunction with other 
sections to the subject of election reform as stated in the title.  The 
General Assembly further finds that a common purpose or relationship 
exists among the sections, representing a potential plurality but not 
disunity of topics, notwithstanding that reasonable minds might differ 
in identifying more than one topic contained in this act.
</p><p>
SECTION&nbsp; &nbsp; 15.&nbsp; &nbsp; The provisions of this act are not
 severable.  If any section, subsection, item, subitem, paragraph, 
sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this act is for any reason held to 
be unconstitutional or invalid, it is to be conclusively presumed that 
the General Assembly would not have enacted any section, subsection, 
item, subitem, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or word of this act 
without the other provisions in this act and therefore this act in its 
entirety will be deemed invalid.
</p><p>
SECTION&nbsp; &nbsp; 16.&nbsp; &nbsp; SECTIONS 14 and 15 are effective upon approval by the Governor.
</p><p>
SECTION&nbsp; &nbsp; 17.&nbsp; &nbsp; SECTIONS 2, 9, 10, 12, and 13 are 
effective upon preclearance approval by the United States Department of 
Justice or approval by a declaratory judgment issued by the United 
States District Court for the District of Columbia, whichever occurs 
first.
</p><p>
SECTION&nbsp; &nbsp; 18.&nbsp; &nbsp; SECTION 3 is effective on July 1, 2011.
</p><p>
SECTION&nbsp; &nbsp; 19.&nbsp; &nbsp; SECTIONS 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are effective on<b> </b>January 2, 2012.
</p><p>
SECTION&nbsp; &nbsp; 20.&nbsp; &nbsp; SECTION 11 takes effect upon 
preclearance approval by the United States Department of Justice or 
approval by a declaratory judgment issued by the United States District 
Court for the District of Columbia, whichever occurs first.  <i> </i>However,
 the implementation of the procedures provided for in this SECTION is 
contingent upon the State Election Commission's receipt of funds 
necessary to implement these provisions.  Until the provisions of this 
SECTION are fully funded and executed, implementation of the provisions 
of this SECTION shall not prohibit the State Election Commission from 
issuing voter registration cards by the methods allowed prior to the 
implementation of this SECTION.
