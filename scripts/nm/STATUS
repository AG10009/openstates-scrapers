notes:
    Bills starting from 1996 can be scraped. However, only
    the current term's legislators (2010) are scraped.
    Votes for a given bill are provided in a pdf file hence
    they are not being collected (a document is added to each
    bill with relevant upper and lower house votes linking to 
    respective pdf files though). Also, all sponsors to a bill
    are added as primary sponsors (since the site does not tell
    us who is the primary sponsor and who is/are co-sponsors).
