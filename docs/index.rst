The Open State Project
=======================

The Open State Project collects and makes available data about state legislative activities, including bill summaries, votes, sponsorships, legislators, and committees. This data is gathered directly from the states and made available in a common format for interested developers, through a :doc:`RESTful API <api>` and regular data dumps. To make working with the API easier, a `Python client library <http://github.com/sunlightlabs/python-fiftystates/>`_ is available.

Because most states do not make their legislative data publicly available in structured formats, we need
to write scrapers to parse information from their publicly-facing websites. This is a large task and one we can always use help on. View our `contributors' guide <http://code.google.com/p/openstates/wiki/Contributing>`_ for information on getting started with the project.
